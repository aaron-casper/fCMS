Congratulations, your database and php are in the correct place and working!

'You may ask yourself "How do I work this?"'

You can remove this post manually using sqlite3.

<code>
sqlite: select * from posts;
82|2019-08-24 15:34:27|
|post content, incl. html formatting
</code>
We use the first INT shown, 82 in this example.
<code>
sqlite: delete from posts where id = 82;
</code>
Tada, vaporized.

To use the content insertion script, create the body of your content "post" in post.txt:
<code>
user@box:../cms~$ nano post.txt
</code>
You can use inline HTML for formatting in a "post".

Then we run the insertion script
<code>
user@box:../cms~$ python post.py
</code>
You will be prompted for a title, and if the formatting looks correct prior to your post
being committed to the database.

The same process for removing this "post" can be used to remove posts with errors for revision.

Enjoy, tinker, and improve it!
